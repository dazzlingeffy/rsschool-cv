The main goal of my life is *don't stop learning and teach others what you’ve learned*. Even if I reach success in something I ask myself questions like *"What is my next step? What I should learn to make it better? How many useful experiences I achieved while I was working on it?"* Now I found a huge field of interesting work and I'm going to explore it. I will make very beautiful websites, useful apps, share with other people what I had already known. But everything has its own time.

For now, I have got some experience in various fields of programming world. I am familiar with **HTML**, **CSS**, **Bash**, **Git**, **C**, working in **IDEs**, **SQL**, etc. I have tried myself at learning **algorithms**, **Docker**, I learned **Java** as my first programming language. Telling in a nutshell after all that I have done I am leaning towards **iOS-development** and all that goes with it. After I graduated from a college I took courses on *JavaRush*. When I enrolled in the *21School* I set the Java course on pause. During my studies there I learned lots of **CS** aspects, I learned **С syntax** and **IDEs (VSCode, CLion)**. I learned some algorithms and Docker basics. Once upon a time I took part in Hackathon about CV (Computer Vision), were I was to create database with car lisence plates and information about its owner. At the same time when I was home I spent my time exploring the basics of Front-End and Back-end development. And the first one inspired me. I have been learning English since I was 2 years old. My grandmother was my mentor. Also, I went on to an English course with a native speaker. As for me the main practice is to talk with English-speaking strangers using the Internet.
